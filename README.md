# restaurant-page
A simple webpage built to practice using webpack, following [TOP](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) curriculum.

See it live [here](https://petracore.github.io/restaurant-page/) to witness me utilizing 110% of my creative potential to create the most breathtaking restaurant name.

...

You cannot deny that it does sound *very* italian though!  Well... unless you actually know the language unlike me

The filler content (homepage text, menu, contact) info was created in collaboration with my beloved unpaid intern - ChatGPT!

### My adjustments to the project
- I thought that hardcoding the menu into the page would be quite *not smart*, since menus tend to change over time.  Therefore, I made my page generate it dynamically.
- Once again I attempted to make the website responsive, despite being told not to do it at this point in the curriculum. I am just *that kind* of person, ok?
